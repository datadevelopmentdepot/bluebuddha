A series of the most logical steps in a series of clicks and text dumps that hasn't gotten me banned yet.

Data Department Depot LLC is a religious and educational institution that was created for a United States branch of the Telepathic Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation (TPAWBF). All data, information, and creations should be considered “as is” and hold no warranty. Any proceeds, donations, investments should go towards the individual financial departments of the performers that have insofar been assembled by the enlightened simp and Gizmo.

These individual branches will invest capital on the tools of their respective trades, food, and housing while they work to on child and adult online community building through experimental writing/research/development of content creation for the less fortunate, and educational and entertainment content for other online creators, mentors, and consultants. We want to foster a habit of consensual and competent content creation that if anything improves the human condition through humor, mutual understanding, and love of the game.

All donations are voluntary and will not be refunded once they clear with the respective company's financial branch. Data Department Depot LLC does not transfer any good or service in response to any investment to any branch of the federation, no matter how large. It is an independent LLC that creates content and analysis at the sole operator's leisure and they do not align with any group, gang, or party other than the federation they have created through rigorous interviews and study that should be considered proprietary and as valuable as their other intellectual assets. If you have any questions or comments about Data Department Depot LLC, their religious and educational competence to practice in this sphere, or their ability to work within the IRL community towards common goals without unnecessary state mandated oversight please contact sharkturtle3@icloud.com.
